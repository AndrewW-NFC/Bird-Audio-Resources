This document tracks bird sound resources, with an emphasis on nocturnal flight call recording. Just sort of throwing everything in here for now but will tidy up eventually.

# Low-cost recorders
## For purchase
* AudioMoth: [openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth](https://openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth).
* BirdWeather PUC: [birdweather.com](https://birdweather.com). Explore the 1,700+ BirdWeather stations, mostly in North America and Europe: [app.birdweather.com](https://app.birdweather.com). This device, which makes live identifications using the BirdNET API, is good for passive monintoring and recording of bird calls but has not proven effective for nocturnal flight calls. See "BirdNET API" below as to why.
## DIY (with a purchase option)
* [OldBird 21c](http://oldbird.org)
# Recording setups at various price-points
* See Nocturnal Flight Calls Facebook group below

# Guides and Communities
* [Nocturnal Flight Calls of North America](https://nocturnalflightcalls.com/): an online reference guide to nocturnal flight call spectrograms
* [Peterson Field Guide to Bird Sounds of Eastern North America](https://harpercollins.com/products/peterson-field-guide-to-bird-sounds-of-eastern-north-america-nathan-pieplow). Includes an introduction on how to read spectrograms, and indexes for looking up species by sound qualities. There is an [online version](https://academy.allaboutbirds.org/peterson-field-guide-to-bird-sounds), but it is searchable only by species name, not by sound types or qualities.
* Facebook group ["Nocturnal Flight Calls"](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NocturnalFlightCalls/). Includes [a thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NocturnalFlightCalls/posts/10165508057595436/) about people's different NFC recording setups. The group is set to private, so you must submit a request to join and view content.
* Reddit community: [r/fieldrecording](https://www.reddit.com/r/fieldrecording/). Not specific to bird sound recording but a good resource for recording equipment recommendations and technical advice.
* ["AudioMoth: a practical guide to the open-source ARU"](https://github.com/rhine3/audiomoth-guide/blob/master/guide.md) (ARU = autonomous recording unit)

# Nocturnal Migration Forecasting and Alerts
* [BirdCast migration tools](https://birdcast.info/migration-tools): Use to plan for good NFC nights and anticipate migrant species

# The eBird NFC protocol
* If you use eBird to track your observations, you should follow [its Nocturnal Flight Call Count protocol](https://support.ebird.org/en/support/solutions/articles/48000950859-guide-to-ebird-protocols#anchorNFC). Remember that eBird checklists ultimately feed into ornithological research; following protocols is thus essential for researchers to be sure they are analyzing data that have been collected in consistent ways. The NFC protocol differs from the more familiar ones. For example, since it's impossible to tally birds while they're migrating high in the dark, the NFC protocol asks you to count the _number of recorded calls_ and include those counts as species comments. 

# Software
* [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org) for "viewing", listening to, and editing recordings
* [Vesper](https://github.com/RichardLitt/nfc-resources) and Nighthawk, software specifically for analyzing long NFC recording sessions. I've yet to try these.
* [Merlin](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/): the go-to bird sound ID app. Does not work well for NFCs.
* [BirdNET API](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/api/): web-based bird sound ID. Unless you're using the API for other projects, consider this merely a backup option for Merlin, as its matches aren't filtered by date and location

> [!NOTE]
> Machine learning-based programs like Merlin and BirdNET aren't as well trained on flight calls as they are on songs and regular calls. Expect that NFCs will not result in positive identifications. This is also why it's so important to learn spectrograms.

# Bird Audio Repositories
* The Macaulay Library, Cornell University. [This link](https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog?mediaType=audio&tag=flight_call) takes you to a Macaulay search for flight calls, though not necessarily nocturnal flight calls. Keep an eye out for usernames that include "NFC", "NFC Station", etc.
* [Xeno-Canto](https://xeno-canto.org). [This link](https://xeno-canto.org/explore?query=type:%22nocturnal%20flight%20call%22) takes you to a Xeno-Canto search for nocturnal flight calls.

# Skills Development
* [Earbider](https://earbirder.com): Custom sound/sprectogram quizzes, including filtering by flight calls or NFC stations only
* [eBird quizzes](https://ebird.org/quiz): Location- and date-specific quizzes on all bird sounds, not just NFCs.
